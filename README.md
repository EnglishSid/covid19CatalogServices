# covid19 Catalog Services
Automate the assessment of service offers from suppliers to identify the correct response from the UK Government.

The response could vary from `Inform the cabinet` to `advise the supplier to work with their local NHS response team`

## Problem Statement
> Suppliers and individuals are offering their services in support of the COVID19 pandemic; the sheer volume of offers is almost impossible to manage for a single government department or entry point.   The high volume is impacting the means to identify where an offer meets a current urgent need, highlights a potential new area of support or is a potential distraction; thus resulting in the risk to miss a key offer in this time critical response.

## The challenge
How to bring business intelligence to help identity the right suppliers for the 1000's of requests being raised by various UK government departments.

## Personas

### Government department
Government department with a clear requirement to help support the COVID19 response

### Suppliers
General suppliers of any potential services to the government.

### Scoring

1. Immediate value
2. Near term value 
3. Mid term value 
4. Long term value
5. Local community value
